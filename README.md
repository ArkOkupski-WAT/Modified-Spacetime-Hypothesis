# Modified-Spacetime-Hypothesis
The hypothesis treats spacetime not as a passive backdrop for matter, but as an equal partner in physical transformations. The inspiration stems from explosive chemistryâ€”specifically, how the detonation of high-energy materials  mixtures) converts condensed matter into expanding gases and energy.

*A speculative model linking nucleosynthesis to spacetime geometry*  

## ðŸ“œ Abstract  
We propose that dark matter effects emerge from the coupling between chemical composition (metallicity) and spacetime geometry via a scalar field Ï•(x). Iron (A=56) acts as a critical threshold for spacetime "compression" (âˆ†CP < 0) or "stretching" (âˆ†CP > 0).  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features  
- **No dark matter particles** â€“ effects arise from spacetime-chemical coupling  
- **Iron-rich regions** (galactic cores) generate additional gravity  
- **Metal-poor galaxies** (H/He-dominated) obey standard GR  
- Quantum field **Î¨** unifies matter and spacetime phases
